# DeepLinkProject
This is a sample project with a modified Wikipedia iOS app included on git.

# Instructions
Please first install the Wikipedia app first in simulator or on a real device, then install the Deeplink app. After installing you can start getting the locations and press on one of the locations to open the Wikipedia app with the right location.

# Architecture
We chose for a MVVM architecture because of easy testability.

# ToDo
Because of limited time, I added a list of features to be still added to the project below:
- UI (make it more appealing, add splashscreen + colors + logo + animations)
- Add DomainObjects in between the API-Model "Coordinates"
- More Unit Testing

# Required dependencies
- Moya framework for iOS
